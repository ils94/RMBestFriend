# About

RMBF (RM Best Friend) is another one of my tools, but this one focus more on RM gameplay. This tool adds pixel recognition to detect when your partner is on low health to use healing.

It also have a Buffer and a GT Buffer that you can setup to keep the buffs up!

Playing on FireFox allow this tool to send the keystrokes even if FireFox is not being focused! Meaning you can do other tasks on your computer while your RM still keeps supporting your partner!*

*The FireFox window needs to still be visible on your screen, otherwise it won't be able to detect your partner's hp bar therefor it won't heal!

After you setup everything, you can minimize the overlay and close the Keys Setup window. Do not close the overlay! It needs to be open, just minimize it and let it go.

# Notes

Go to a mob and hit it enough to leave it at low health, then keep dragging the rectangle where it's HP bar is until the program detects the enemy HP bar. It not hard to setup, make the rectangle a bit bigger to give the program enough coordinates to perform the pixel recognition.

# IT BUGGED!

Close it and reopen.
